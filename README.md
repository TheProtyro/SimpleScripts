# SimpleScripts

A suite of simple scripts that I have crafted for some reasons. 
Feel free to grab and modify them if you want :)

Below is the usage for them :

```
python3 FingerUserEnum.py -h
python3 FingerUserEnum.py 10.10.10.10 /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt --threads 50
```

```
python3 BadChars.py -h
python3 BadChars.py 
python3 BadChars.py -f stack_dump
```
